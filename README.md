Creating an automated system that monitors competitors' LinkedIn activity,
specifically targeting decision-makers' new connections. Based on the 'About Us'
section, job description, or recent posts of these new connections, the automation
should generate a hyper-personalized connection request to be sent from your
LinkedIn account. You are expected to use Python for this task.
Please ensure your solution is hosted on GitHub so that it is easy to track changes,
collaborate, and review code.
